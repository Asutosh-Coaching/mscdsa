#### `15.4` Linear Regression

##### 📘 Theoretical Principles & Pedagogical Exposition
Regression analysis is a common statistical technique for establishing a relationship model between two variables. One of these variables is known as a predictor variable, and its value is derived via experimentation. The response variable, whose value is generated from the predictor variable, is the other variable.

A regression model that employs a straight line to explain the relationship between variables is known as linear regression. In Linear Regression these two variables are related through an equation, where the exponent (power) of both these variables is one. It searches for the value of the regression coefficient(s) that minimises the total error of the model to find the line of best fit through your data.

The general equation for a linear regression is – 𝑦 = 𝑎+ 𝑏 × 𝑥 In the equation given above: ● y is called response/dependent variable, whereas x is an independent/predictor variable. ● The a and b values are the coefficients used in the equation, which are to be predicted. The objective of the regression model is to determine the values of these two constants.


##### ⚙️ Mathematical & Algorithmic Mechanics
- **Core Mechanism:** Linear transformations represented by $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$. Matrix invertibility requires non-zero determinant $\det(A) \neq 0$ and full column/row rank. Eigen-decomposition $A v = \lambda v$ identifies invariant directional axes and scaling factors.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Singular matrices (det = 0), ill-conditioned matrices with condition number $\kappa(A) \gg 1$, and rank deficiency under collinear feature dimensions.

##### 📊 Practical Data Science & Production Relevance
- **Production Workflow:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA covariance decomposition), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) normal equations $(X^T X)^{-1} X^T y$, and embedding projection transformations in transformers.
- **Real-World Pitfall:** Inverting ill-conditioned matrices directly instead of using singular value decomposition (SVD) or QR decomposition, triggering catastrophic floating-point cancellation.

> [!TIP]
> **Exam & Technical Interview Insight:** Practice row reduction to Row Echelon Form (REF) to find matrix rank, determinant expansion by minors, and computing characteristic equations $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$.

#### `15.5` Multiple Regression

##### 📘 Theoretical Principles & Pedagogical Exposition
The relationship between two or more independent variables and a single dependent variable is estimated using multiple linear regression. When you need to know the following, you can utilize multiple linear regression. ● The degree to which two or more independent variables and one dependent variable are related (e.g.

how baking soda, baking temperature, and amount of flour added affect the taste of cake). ● The dependent variable's value at a given value of the independent variables (e.g. the taste of cake for different amount of baking soda, baking temperature, and flour). The general equation for multiple linear regression is – y = a + b1X1 + b2X2 +...bnXn where, ● y is response variable.

● a, b1, b2...bn are coefficients. ● X1, X2, ...Xn are predictor variables. The lm() function in R is used to generate the regression model. Using the input data, the model calculates the coefficient values. Using these coefficients, you can then predict the value of the response variable for a given collection of predictor variables.


##### ⚙️ Mathematical & Algorithmic Mechanics
- **Core Mechanism:** Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) minimizes residual sum of squares: $\min_\beta \sum (y_i - x_i^T \beta)^2$. Normal equation analytical solution: $\hat{\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y$. Logistic regression applies sigmoid link $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$ optimizing log-likelihood.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Perfect multicollinearity causing singular non-invertible $X^T X$, heteroscedasticity (non-constant residual variance), and high-leverage outlier leverage points.

##### 📊 Practical Data Science & Production Relevance
- **Production Workflow:** Predictive target forecasting, econometric attribution modeling, risk scoring models, and baseline benchmark modeling in data science pipelines.
- **Real-World Pitfall:** High multicollinearity inflating coefficient standard errors, or fitting linear models without verifying residual normality and homoscedasticity plots.

> [!TIP]
> **Exam & Technical Interview Insight:** Derive OLS normal equations; interpret slope $\beta_1$ and intercept $\beta_0$; calculate $R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{\text{res}}}{SS_{\text{tot}}}$ and conduct $F$-tests for overall model significance.

#### `15.6` Logistic Regression

##### 📘 Theoretical Principles & Pedagogical Exposition
In R Programming, logistic regression is a classification algorithm for determining the probability of event success and failure. When the dependent variable is binary (0/1, True/False, Yes/No), logistic regression is utilised. In a binomial distribution, the logit function is utilised as a link function.

Binomial logistic regression is another name for logistic regression. It is based on the sigmoid function, with probability as the output and input ranging from -∞ to +∞.The sigmoid function is given below: 𝑔(𝑧) = ଵ ଵା ௘ష೥ Where 𝑧 = 𝑎 + 𝑏× 𝑥 The general equation for logistic regression is – 𝑔(𝑧) = 1 + 𝑒ି (௔ା௕భ×௫భା௕మ×௫మା௕య×௫యା...) where, y is called as the response variable, and xi are predictors.

The a and bi are coefficients. Data Analysis and R The glm() function is used to construct the regression model. Syntax: glm (formula, data,family) ● The symbol expressing the relationship between the variables is a formula. ● The data set containing the values of these variables is known as data.

#### `15.7` Time Series Analysis

##### 📘 Theoretical Principles & Pedagogical Exposition
A Time Series is any metric that is measured at regular intervals. It entails deriving hidden insights from time-based data (years, days, hours, minutes) in order to make informed decisions. When you have serially associated data, time series models are particularly beneficial. Weather data, stock prices, industry projections, and so on are just a few examples.

A time series is represented as follows: A data point, say (Yt), at a specific time t (indicated by subscript t) is defined as the either sum or product of the following three components: Seasonality (St), Trend (Tt); and Error (et) (also known as, White Noise). Input: Import the data set and then use ts() function.

The steps to use the function are given below. However, it is pertinent to note here that the input values used in this case should ideally be a numeric vector belonging to the “numeric” or “integer” class. The following functions will generate quarterly data series from 1959: ts(inputData, frequency =4, start = c(1959,2)) #frequency 4 => QuarterlyData The following function will generate monthly data series from 1990 ts(1:10, frequency =12, start = 1990) #freq 12 => MonthlyData The following function will generate yearly data series from 2009 to 2014.


##### ⚙️ Mathematical & Algorithmic Mechanics
- **Core Mechanism:** Asymptotic bounds evaluate algorithmic scalability as input size $n \to \infty$: upper bound $\mathcal{O}(g(n))$, lower bound $\Omega(g(n))$, and tight bound $\Theta(g(n))$. Recurrences are solved via the Master Theorem: $T(n) = a T(n/b) + f(n)$.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Degenerate input permutations (e.g. sorted inputs triggering $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ worst-case Quicksort), and recursion call stack memory limits.

##### 📊 Practical Data Science & Production Relevance
- **Production Workflow:** Selecting optimal data structures (hash tables $\mathcal{O}(1)$ vs BSTs $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$), minimizing latency in real-time query engines, and optimizing Big Data batch workloads.
- **Real-World Pitfall:** Ignoring hardware cache locality and constant factors, or inadvertently nesting linear scans within iterative loops yielding hidden $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ complexity.

> [!TIP]
> **Exam & Technical Interview Insight:** Solve recurrences step-by-step using substitution or Master Theorem; state tight $\mathcal{O}$, $\Omega$, and $\Theta$ bounds for best, average, and worst-case scenarios.

##### ⚙️ Mathematical & Algorithmic Mechanics
- **Core Mechanism:** Statistical inference evaluates sample statistics to draw population conclusions. Hypothesis testing contrasts Null $H_0$ against Alternative $H_1$. The $p$-value represents probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme under $H_0$; reject $H_0$ if $p < \alpha$.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Type I error (false positive $\alpha$) vs Type II error (false negative $\beta$), statistical power $1 - \beta$, unequal sample variances in Student's $t$-test, and small cell counts in Chi-Square tests.

##### 📊 Practical Data Science & Production Relevance
- **Production Workflow:** Online experimentation and conversion lift validation (A/B testing), automated model drift monitoring, feature significance selection, and clinical trial efficacy tests.
- **Real-World Pitfall:** $p$-hacking, failing to apply multiple testing corrections (e.g. Bonferroni / FDR) across multiple comparisons, and confusing statistical significance with practical impact.

> [!TIP]
> **Exam & Technical Interview Insight:** State $H_0$ and $H_1$ explicitly; identify the correct test statistic ($Z$, $t$, $F$, or $\chi^2$); determine degrees of freedom and state the clear rejection conclusion.

### 📐 Step-by-Step Solved Mathematical Examples
To solidify your theoretical understanding, work through these fully solved, step-by-step mathematical problems:

#### 🧮 Example 1: Simple Linear Regression OLS Computation
> **Problem Statement:**  
> Given data points $(x, y)$: $(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 6)$. Compute OLS slope $\hat{\beta}_1$, intercept $\hat{\beta}_0$, and regression line.

**Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Means:** $\bar{x} = 3.0, \; \bar{y} = 4.0$.
2. **Deviations & Products:**
- $(x_1 - \bar{x}) = -2, \; (y_1 - \bar{y}) = -2 \implies (-2)(-2) = 4, \; (-2)^2 = 4$
- $(x_2 - \bar{x}) = -1, \; (y_2 - \bar{y}) = -1 \implies (-1)(-1) = 1, \; (-1)^2 = 1$
- $(x_3 - \bar{x}) = 0, \; (y_3 - \bar{y}) = 1 \implies (0)(1) = 0, \; 0^2 = 0$
- $(x_4 - \bar{x}) = 1, \; (y_4 - \bar{y}) = 0 \implies (1)(0) = 0, \; 1^2 = 1$
- $(x_5 - \bar{x}) = 2, \; (y_5 - \bar{y}) = 2 \implies (2)(2) = 4, \; 2^2 = 4$

3. **Summation:** $\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}) = 9, \; \sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 = 10$.

4. **Parameters:**

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{9}{10} = 0.90
$$


$$
\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} = 4.0 - 0.9(3.0) = 4.0 - 2.7 = 1.30
$$


Regression Equation: $\hat{y} = 1.30 + 0.90 x$.

#### 🧮 Example 2: Coefficient of Determination $R^2$ Calculation
> **Problem Statement:**  
> For the model above, total sum of squares $SS_{\text{tot}} = 10.0$ and sum of squared residuals $SS_{\text{res}} = 1.90$. Calculate $R^2$ and interpret.

**Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**


$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{\text{res}}}{SS_{\text{tot}}} = 1 - \frac{1.90}{10.0} = 1 - 0.19 = 0.81 \implies 81\%
$$


Interpretation: 81% of the variation in target $y$ is explained by feature $x$.
