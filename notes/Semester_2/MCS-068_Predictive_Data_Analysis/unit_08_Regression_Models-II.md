### 📖 Core Definitions & Terminology Cards

> 📌 **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)**  
> - **Formal Definition:** Estimation method that minimizes the sum of squared differences (residuals) between observed values and predictions: $\min_\beta \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$.  
> - 💡 **Practical Intuition & Analogy:** *Finding the single line that minimizes total vertical squared distance to all data points.*

> 📌 **Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)**  
> - **Formal Definition:** The proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by independent features: $R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{\text{res}}}{SS_{\text{tot}}}$. Ranges from 0 to 1.  
> - 💡 **Practical Intuition & Analogy:** *An $R^2 = 0.85$ means 85% of target variability is captured by your model.*

> 📌 **Ridge Regularization ($L_2$)**  
> - **Formal Definition:** Adds squared magnitude penalty to the loss function: $\mathcal{L} + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2$. Shrinks weights toward zero to prevent overfitting under multicollinearity.  
> - 💡 **Practical Intuition & Analogy:** *Discourages extreme weight spikes without setting any coefficient entirely to zero.*

> 📌 **Lasso Regularization ($L_1$)**  
> - **Formal Definition:** Adds absolute magnitude penalty to the loss function: $\mathcal{L} + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \vert\beta_j\vert$. Drives non-essential coefficients exactly to zero, performing automated feature selection.  
> - 💡 **Practical Intuition & Analogy:** *Selects a sparse subset of impactful features by zeroing out noise variables.*

### ⚡ Governing Mathematical Laws & Formula Cheatsheet
#### 🔹 Simple Linear Regression OLS Parameters
$$
\begin{aligned} \hat{\beta}_1 & = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2} = \frac{\text{Cov}(x, y)}{\text{Var}(x)} \\ \hat{\beta}_0 & = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} \end{aligned}
$$
- **Explanation:** Closed-form slope and intercept formulas for single-feature linear regression.

#### 🔹 Multiple Linear Regression Normal Equation
$$
\hat{\mathbf{\beta}} = (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y}
$$
- **Explanation:** Direct analytic matrix solution for OLS regression weights.

#### 🔹 Ridge Regression Closed-Form Estimator
$$
\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}_{\text{Ridge}} = (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{y}
$$
- **Explanation:** Adding $\lambda \mathbf{I}$ ensures invertibility even when $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ is ill-conditioned or collinear.

#### 🔹 Logistic Regression Sigmoid Function
$$
P(Y = 1 \mid X = \mathbf{x}) = \sigma(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x} + b)}}
$$
- **Explanation:** Maps any real-valued linear score into a calibrated probability interval $[0, 1]$.
