### 📌 Comprehensive Section-by-Section Study Breakdown
#### `9.3` Techniques of Machine Learning

##### 📘 Theoretical Principles & Pedagogical Exposition
Machine learning uses various algorithms to improve, describe, and predict outcomes by repeated learning from data. It is possible to make models that are more accurate as the algorithms learn from the training data. A machine learning model is what you get when you use data to train your machine learning algorithm.

After it has been trained, a model will give you an output when you give it an input. A predictive model is made, for example, by a predictive algorithm. Then, when you put data into the predictive model, you'll get a prediction based on the data that was used to train the model.

At the moment, analytics models can't be made without machine learning. Machine learning approaches are needed to make prediction models more accurate. Depending on the type and amount of data and the business problem Machine Learning - I being solved, there are different ways to approach the problem.

- **Boundary Conditions:** Curse of dimensionality in high dimensions, severe class imbalance (requiring SMOTE or class-weighted loss), and poor centroid initialization in K-Means.

##### 📊 Practical Data Science & Production Relevance

#### `9.4` Reinforcement Learning and Algorithms

##### 📘 Theoretical Principles & Pedagogical Exposition
ALGORITHMS According to what we observed in the previous section, learning can be broken down into three main categories: supervised, unsupervised, and semi- supervised. However, in addition to these two categories, there are also other types of learning, such as reinforcement learning (RL), deep learning (DL), adaptive learning, and so on.

The graph shown below, depicts the various branches and sub-branches of Machine learning, including the various algorithms involved in each sub- branch. Let’s understand them in brief, as the entire coverage of the said Machine Learning techniques is out of the scope of this unit.

We will begin our discussion with Reinforcement learning. Introduction to Machine Learning Methods In Reinforcement Learning (RL), algorithms get a set of instructions and rules and then figure out how to handle a task by trying things out and seeing what works and what doesn't. As a way to help the AI find the best way to solve a problem, decisions are either rewarded or punished.


##### ⚙️ Mathematical & Algorithmic Mechanics
- **Core Mechanism:** Asymptotic bounds evaluate algorithmic scalability as input size $n \to \infty$: upper bound $\mathcal{O}(g(n))$, lower bound $\Omega(g(n))$, and tight bound $\Theta(g(n))$. Recurrences are solved via the Master Theorem: $T(n) = a T(n/b) + f(n)$.
- **Boundary Conditions:** Degenerate input permutations (e.g. sorted inputs triggering $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ worst-case Quicksort), and recursion call stack memory limits.

##### 📊 Practical Data Science & Production Relevance
- **Production Workflow:** Selecting optimal data structures (hash tables $\mathcal{O}(1)$ vs BSTs $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$), minimizing latency in real-time query engines, and optimizing Big Data batch workloads.
- **Real-World Pitfall:** Ignoring hardware cache locality and constant factors, or inadvertently nesting linear scans within iterative loops yielding hidden $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ complexity.

#### `9.5` Deep Learning and Algorithms

##### 📘 Theoretical Principles & Pedagogical Exposition
Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks and representation learning. It is also called deep structured learning or differential programming.Deep learning is a way for machines to learn through Introduction to Machine Learning Methods deep neural networks.

It is used a lot to solve practical problems in fields like computer vision (image), natural language processing (text), and automated speech recognition (audio). Machine learning is often thought of as a tool with several algorithms. However, deep learning is actually just a subset of approaches that mostly use neural networks, which are a type of algorithm loosely based on the human brain.

A deep learning model learns to solve classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound. A neural network architecture is commonly used to implement deep learning. The number of layers in a network defines the depth of the network; the more layers, the deeper the network.

#### `9.6` Ensemble Methods

##### 📘 Theoretical Principles & Pedagogical Exposition
Ensemble learning is a general meta approach to machine learning that combines predictions from different models to improve predictive performance. Although you can create an apparently infinite number of ensembles for any predictive modelling problem, the subject of ensemble learning is dominated by three methods.

Bagging, stacking, and boosting. They are the three primary classes of ensemble learning methods, and it's essential to understand each one thoroughly. • Bagging Ensemble learning is the process of fitting multiple decision trees to various samples of the same dataset and averaging the results.

• Stacking Ensemble learning is fitting multiple types of models to the same data and then using another model to learn how to combine the predictions in the best way possible. • Boosting Ensemble Learning entails successively adding ensemble members that correct prior model predictions and produce a weighted average of the predictions.

### 📐 Step-by-Step Solved Mathematical Examples
To solidify your theoretical understanding, work through these fully solved, step-by-step mathematical problems:

#### 🧮 Example 1: Shannon Entropy and Information Gain Calculation
> **Problem Statement:**  
> A training dataset $S$ has 14 instances: 9 Positive ($+$) and 5 Negative ($-$). An attribute $A$ splits $S$ into $S_1$ (6 $+$, 2 $-$) and $S_2$ (3 $+$, 3 $-$). Compute Entropy $H(S)$ and Information Gain $IG(S, A)$.

**Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Parent Entropy $H(S)$:**

$$
H(S) = -\left(\frac{9}{14} \log_2 \frac{9}{14} + \frac{5}{14} \log_2 \frac{5}{14}\right) \approx 0.940 \text{ bits}
$$


2. **Subset Entropies:**
- For $S_1$ (total 8): $H(S_1) = -\left(\frac{6}{8}\log_2\frac{6}{8} + \frac{2}{8}\log_2\frac{2}{8}\right) = 0.811 \text{ bits}$
- For $S_2$ (total 6): $H(S_2) = -\left(\frac{3}{6}\log_2\frac{3}{6} + \frac{3}{6}\log_2\frac{3}{6}\right) = 1.000 \text{ bits}$

3. **Weighted Child Entropy:**

$$
H(S, A) = \frac{8}{14}(0.811) + \frac{6}{14}(1.000) = 0.463 + 0.429 = 0.892 \text{ bits}
$$


4. **Information Gain:**

$$
IG(S, A) = H(S) - H(S, A) = 0.940 - 0.892 = 0.048 \text{ bits}
$$

(Attribute provides 0.048 bits of entropy reduction).

#### 🧮 Example 2: A* Search Step Evaluation
> **Problem Statement:**  
> In graph navigation, node $N$ has exact path cost from start $g(N) = 14$ and straight-line heuristic to goal $h(N) = 11$. For node $M$, $g(M) = 18, h(M) = 6$. Which node is expanded next by A*?

**Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. Compute $f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$:
- $f(N) = 14 + 11 = 25$
- $f(M) = 18 + 6 = 24$

2. Decision: A* selects the node with minimal $f(n)$. Since $f(M) = 24 < f(N) = 25$, **Node $M$ is expanded next**.

### 💻 Practical Data Science Implementation (Python)
Theory translates directly into production algorithms. Below is a self-contained, commented Python implementation illustrating the core operations of this unit:

```python
import numpy as np

# Decision Tree Entropy and Information Gain from scratch
def entropy(labels):
    counts = np.bincount(labels)
    probs = counts[counts > 0] / len(labels)
    return -np.sum(probs * np.log2(probs))

def information_gain(parent_labels, left_split, right_split):
    h_parent = entropy(parent_labels)
    n = len(parent_labels)
    h_children = (len(left_split)/n)*entropy(left_split) + (len(right_split)/n)*entropy(right_split)
    return h_parent - h_children

# Sample binary targets: 9 ones, 5 zeros
y_parent = np.array([1]*9 + [0]*5)
y_left = np.array([1]*6 + [0]*2)
y_right = np.array([1]*3 + [0]*3)

ig = information_gain(y_parent, y_left, y_right)
print(f"Parent Entropy: {entropy(y_parent):.4f}")
print(f"Information Gain: {ig:.4f} bits")
```
