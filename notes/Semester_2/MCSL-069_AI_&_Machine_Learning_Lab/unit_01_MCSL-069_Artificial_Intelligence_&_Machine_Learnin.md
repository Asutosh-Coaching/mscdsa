### 📖 Core Definitions & Terminology Cards

> 📌 **A* Search Algorithm**  
> - **Formal Definition:** Best-first graph search evaluating states by $f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$, where $g(n)$ is true cost from start to $n$, and $h(n)$ is heuristic estimate to goal. Guarantees optimal path if $h(n)$ is admissible ( $h(n) \le h^*(n)$ ).  
> - 💡 **Practical Intuition & Analogy:** *Finding the fastest route on GPS navigation without exploring irrelevant directions.*

> 📌 **Entropy and Information Gain**  
> - **Formal Definition:** Entropy $H(S) = -\sum p_i \log_2 p_i$ measures impurity. Information Gain $IG(S, A) = H(S) - \sum \frac{\vert S_v \vert}{\vert S \vert} H(S_v)$ measures reduction in entropy achieved by splitting on feature $A$.  
> - 💡 **Practical Intuition & Analogy:** *The mathematical criterion used by Decision Trees to select the most informative split attribute.*

> 📌 **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Margin**  
> - **Formal Definition:** Linear classifier finding the hyperplane maximizing the geometric margin $\frac{2}{\Vert\mathbf{w}\Vert}$ between classes, subject to $y_i(\mathbf{w}^T \mathbf{x}_i + b) \ge 1$. Non-linear data is separated using Kernel functions $K(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z}) = \phi(\mathbf{x})^T \phi(\mathbf{z})$.  
> - 💡 **Practical Intuition & Analogy:** *Finding the widest possible road separating positive and negative data clusters.*

> 📌 **Backpropagation Algorithm**  
> - **Formal Definition:** Iterative parameter optimization in neural networks utilizing the multivariate chain rule to propagate error gradients backwards from the loss function to update synaptic weights: $w_{ij} \leftarrow w_{ij} - \alpha \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial w_{ij}}$.  
> - 💡 **Practical Intuition & Analogy:** *Automated blame assignment: adjusting each internal weight proportionally to how much it contributed to prediction error.*

### ⚡ Governing Mathematical Laws & Formula Cheatsheet
#### 🔹 A* Heuristic Evaluation Function
$$
f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \quad \text{Admissibility: } 0 \le h(n) \le h^*(n)
$$
- **Explanation:** If $h(n)$ never overestimates true remaining cost, A* tree search is guaranteed to return the optimal shortest path.

#### 🔹 Shannon Entropy Formula
$$
H(S) = -\sum_{i=1}^c p_i \log_2 p_i \quad \text{Gini Impurity: } 1 - \sum_{i=1}^c p_i^2
$$
- **Explanation:** Measures disorder in classification distributions; equals 0 when all samples belong to one class.

#### 🔹 Gradient Descent Weight Update Rule
$$
\mathbf{w}^{(t+1)} = \mathbf{w}^{(t)} - \alpha \nabla_{\mathbf{w}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{w})
$$
- **Explanation:** Stepping parameter vector opposite to the gradient vector scaled by learning rate $\alpha$.

#### 🔹 Neural Network Output Softmax Function
$$
\text{Softmax}(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^K e^{z_j}}
$$
- **Explanation:** Normalizes $K$ arbitrary logit outputs into a valid multi-class probability distribution summing to 1.

### ⚖️ Axiomatic Properties & Governing Laws
The mathematical formulations of this module are anchored by foundational algebraic and structural laws:

- **Heuristic Consistency Condition:** $h(n) \le c(n, a, n') + h(n') \implies \text{Monotonic (Guarantees A* optimality on graphs)}$

### 📐 Step-by-Step Solved Mathematical Examples
To solidify your theoretical understanding, work through these fully solved, step-by-step mathematical problems:

#### 🧮 Example 1: Shannon Entropy and Information Gain Calculation
> **Problem Statement:**  
> A training dataset $S$ has 14 instances: 9 Positive ($+$) and 5 Negative ($-$). An attribute $A$ splits $S$ into $S_1$ (6 $+$, 2 $-$) and $S_2$ (3 $+$, 3 $-$). Compute Entropy $H(S)$ and Information Gain $IG(S, A)$.

**Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Parent Entropy $H(S)$:**

$$
H(S) = -\left(\frac{9}{14} \log_2 \frac{9}{14} + \frac{5}{14} \log_2 \frac{5}{14}\right) \approx 0.940 \text{ bits}
$$


2. **Subset Entropies:**
- For $S_1$ (total 8): $H(S_1) = -\left(\frac{6}{8}\log_2\frac{6}{8} + \frac{2}{8}\log_2\frac{2}{8}\right) = 0.811 \text{ bits}$
- For $S_2$ (total 6): $H(S_2) = -\left(\frac{3}{6}\log_2\frac{3}{6} + \frac{3}{6}\log_2\frac{3}{6}\right) = 1.000 \text{ bits}$

3. **Weighted Child Entropy:**

$$
H(S, A) = \frac{8}{14}(0.811) + \frac{6}{14}(1.000) = 0.463 + 0.429 = 0.892 \text{ bits}
$$


4. **Information Gain:**

$$
IG(S, A) = H(S) - H(S, A) = 0.940 - 0.892 = 0.048 \text{ bits}
$$

(Attribute provides 0.048 bits of entropy reduction).

#### 🧮 Example 2: A* Search Step Evaluation
> **Problem Statement:**  
> In graph navigation, node $N$ has exact path cost from start $g(N) = 14$ and straight-line heuristic to goal $h(N) = 11$. For node $M$, $g(M) = 18, h(M) = 6$. Which node is expanded next by A*?

**Detailed Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. Compute $f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$:
- $f(N) = 14 + 11 = 25$
- $f(M) = 18 + 6 = 24$

2. Decision: A* selects the node with minimal $f(n)$. Since $f(M) = 24 < f(N) = 25$, **Node $M$ is expanded next**.

### 💻 Practical Data Science Implementation (Python)
Theory translates directly into production algorithms. Below is a self-contained, commented Python implementation illustrating the core operations of this unit:

```python
import numpy as np

# Decision Tree Entropy and Information Gain from scratch
def entropy(labels):
    counts = np.bincount(labels)
    probs = counts[counts > 0] / len(labels)
    return -np.sum(probs * np.log2(probs))

def information_gain(parent_labels, left_split, right_split):
    h_parent = entropy(parent_labels)
    n = len(parent_labels)
    h_children = (len(left_split)/n)*entropy(left_split) + (len(right_split)/n)*entropy(right_split)
    return h_parent - h_children

# Sample binary targets: 9 ones, 5 zeros
y_parent = np.array([1]*9 + [0]*5)
y_left = np.array([1]*6 + [0]*2)
y_right = np.array([1]*3 + [0]*3)

ig = information_gain(y_parent, y_left, y_right)
print(f"Parent Entropy: {entropy(y_parent):.4f}")
print(f"Information Gain: {ig:.4f} bits")
```
